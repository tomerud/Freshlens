## Backend Overview   
The backend uses a MySQL database to accurately record updates from cameras—keeping track of item entries and changes in real time. 

At the same time, it stores fridge images in MongoDB, providing visual records of the fridge contents. The backend also performs waste analysis to identify patterns in discarded items, which helps in generating practical recommendations for better customer habits. 

Additionally, by integrating ChatGPT, it offers recipe suggestions based on foods that are nearing expiration, with the goal of minimizing waste.

## MySQL Database explanation

### **subscription**
- **Purpose:** Stores the available subscription plans.
- **Key Columns:**
  - `subscription_id` (INT, AUTO_INCREMENT, PRIMARY KEY) – Unique identifier for each subscription.
  - `subscription_name` (VARCHAR(255)) – Name (e.g., free, plus, premium).
  - `monthly_cost` (DECIMAL(10,2)) – Monthly price.
- we will implement different features based on the type of the user subscription - future work
---

### **users**
- **Purpose:** Contains registered user data.
- **Key Columns:**
  - `user_id` (VARCHAR(28), UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY) – Unique user ID.
  - `user_name` (VARCHAR(255)) – Full name.
  - `user_email` (VARCHAR(255)) – Email address.
  - `date_subscribed` (DATE) – Date of subscription.
  - `subscription_id` (INT) – Foreign key linking to `subscription`.

- **Global User Context & Firebase Integration:**
  We have implemented Firebase authentication using Google as our identity provider. Upon successfully connecting to Firebase, we verify whether the user already exists in   our system. If the user is new, we add them to our users table—this process is handled in our "firebas.ts" file. Once authenticated, the user's information is stored in     a global context, making it accessible throughout the entire application.
---

### **fridges**
- **Purpose:** Represents a user's fridge.
- **Key Columns:**
  - `fridge_id` (INT, AUTO_INCREMENT, PRIMARY KEY) – Unique fridge ID.
  - `user_id` (VARCHAR(28)) – Foreign key from `users`.
  - `fridge_name` (VARCHAR(255)) – Fridge name (e.g., "my home fridge").

---

### **categories**
- **Purpose:** Lists product categories.
- **Key Columns:**
  - `category_id` (INT, AUTO_INCREMENT, PRIMARY KEY) – Unique category ID.
  - `category_name` (VARCHAR(255)) – Category name (e.g., Dairy, Fruits).

---

### **product_global_info**
- **Purpose:** Stores detailed product information.
  
  In our system, a "product" (like an apple) represents a generic food product, while an "item" is a specific instance of that product - such as the particular apple in your fridge. This is the reason we keep nutritional values on this table.
  
- **Key Columns:**
  - `product_id` (INT, AUTO_INCREMENT, PRIMARY KEY) – Unique product ID.
  - `product_name` (VARCHAR(255), NOT NULL) – Product name.
  - `category_id` (INT, NOT NULL) – Foreign key from `categories`.
  - Other columns (nullable): `serving_size`, `energy_kcal`, `protein_g`, `fat_g`, `saturated_fat_g`, `carbs_g`, `sugars_g`, `fiber_g`, `sodium_mg`.

- **Product Nutritional Values & USDA API Integration:**
  When we add a new product, we query the USDA API using the product's name to grab its nutritional info.
  It then extracts key nutrients (like energy, protein, fats, carbs, sugars, fiber, and sodium) and adjusts the values to a per-100g basis using the provided serving size.   
  If the API doesnt returns an error we store the standardized nutritional data in product_global_info table.

---

### **camera**
- **Purpose:** Maps a camera to a fridge.
- **Key Columns:**
  - `camera_ip` (VARCHAR(255), PRIMARY KEY) – Camera IP address.
  - `fridge_id` (INT) – Foreign key from `fridges`.

---

### **item**
- **Purpose:** Records items detected in a fridge.
- **Key Columns:**
  - `item_id` (INT, NOT NULL, UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY) – Unique item ID.
  - `is_inserted_by_user` (BOOLEAN, NOT NULL) – Indicates if manually inserted.
  - `product_id` (INT) – Foreign key from `product_global_info`.
  - `camera_ip` (VARCHAR(255)) – Foreign key from `camera`.
  - `date_entered` (DATE) – Date of entry.
  - `anticipated_expiry_date` (DATE) – Expected expiry date.
  - `remove_from_fridge_date` (DATE) – Reccomended Removal date (for now same as expiry date but in future models a more accurate estimation will be possible).
  - `is_rotten` (BOOLEAN) – Indicates if the item is considered rotten.

---

### **canadian_products_prices**
- **Purpose:** Stores Canadian pricing data.
- **Key Columns:**
  - `id` (INT, AUTO_INCREMENT, PRIMARY KEY) – Unique record ID.
  - `name` (VARCHAR(255), NOT NULL) – Product name.
  - `price` (DECIMAL(10,2), NOT NULL) – Price.

- **Product Prices & Kaggle Integration:**
We load data from the Canadian Grocery Store Prices dataset on Kaggle.
We tried hard to find an Israeli dataset, but they were either not free or required Hebrew translation which turned out to be a hassle ("Belpeper" translation weren’t great..).
So, we ended up using this dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joelmills2/canadian-grocery-store-prices?select=atlantic_superstore.csv

### **food_storage_tips**
- **Purpose:** Provides food storage tips.
- **Key Columns:**
  - `id` (INT, AUTO_INCREMENT, PRIMARY KEY) – Unique tip ID.
  - `product_name` (VARCHAR(255), NOT NULL) – Name of product.
  - `refrigerate_tips` (TEXT) – Tips for refrigeration.
  - `freeze_tips` (TEXT) – Tips for freezing.
  - `is_specific_product_tip` (BOOLEAN) – Indicates if tip is specific.

- **Spesific Food Storage Tips & Foodkeeper Integration:**
We offer two types of food storage tips.

1. The general tips: manually curated for our HomePage (can be improved over time..)

2. Product specific tips (for example, "don't freeze cucumber") are extracted from a JSON file sourced from the Foodkeeper dataset: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/fsis-foodkeeper-data/resource/2128aebe-b3dd-4b4d-8315-e88d106bd741?inner_span=True.

  - `user_id` (VARCHAR(28), NOT NULL) – Foreign key from `users`.
  - `product_id` (INT, NOT NULL) – Foreign key from `product_global_info`.
  - `is_thrown` (BOOLEAN, NOT NULL) – Indicates if the item was thrown.
  - `date_entered` (DATE, NOT NULL) – Date when the record was created.
 

## API endpoints

### `module_connect.py`
This file establish the websocket connection with the CV module, and applies changes to the database accordingly - adding items, removing or updating (the expiration date) as necessary based on the information from the cameras.

### `chat.py`
Uses OpenAI’s API to generate two recipes based on the given inventory, emphasizing ingredients nearing expiration. It loads the API key from environment variables using dotenv, constructs a detailed prompt (including the current date and inventory data), and calls the GPT‑3.5‑turbo model to generate and return the recipes.
Since we have used OpenAI api, you will need to replace it with your own api key.

### `camera_routes.py`
Provides an endpoint (`/add_camera`) to add a new camera record. It validates the input and inserts the camera data into the database.

### `data_analysis_routes.py`
Offers several endpoints for data analysis:
- **/get_notifications** – Generates expiry notifications for items nearing expiration.
- **/get_shopping_cart_recommendations** – Returns product recommendations based on predicted waste.
- **/get_waste_summary** and **/get_top_thrown_products** – Provide waste analysis data grouped by week and the top three most discarded products, respectively.

### `fridge_routes.py`
Handles fridge-related operations such as:
- Adding a fridge (`/add_fridge`).
- Retrieving all fridges for a user.
- Fetching a fridge's name, categories, products, and specific product items.
- Obtaining product nutrient data, pricing, storage tips, and calculating a freshness score.
- Retrieving the latest image for each camera associated with a user’s fridges and grouping them by fridge.

### `item_routes.py`
Provides an endpoint (`/insert_item`) to insert a new item record into the database after validating and converting date fields.

### `recipe_routes.py`
Uses the inventory from a given fridge (fetched via an expiry query) and passes it to a ChatGPT-based function (`generate_recipe`) to generate two recipes. The output is then formatted as structured JSON.

### `user_routes.py`
Contains endpoints for user management tasks, including checking if a user already exists, updating user subscriptions, and signing up new users.
