## About

FreshLens is a innovative project developed during our university E-commerce workshop (0368-3557).
in the workshop we have worked with MBA and design students, in order to develop our own project.

FreshLens aims to transforms any standard refrigerator into a smart fridge by combining affordable cameras and machine learning tech.  
The system detects and tracks products in the fridge, monitors their freshness (by leveraging DL module), provides alerts, purchase recommendations, and recipe suggestions to reduce food waste and improve consumer habits.

## Main Features
- **Item Detection and Tracking**: Automatically identifies and monitors items placed in the refrigerator using YOLO and DeepSORT algorithms.
- **Freshness Monitoring**: Utilizes OCR to read expiration dates and YOLO to estimate the freshness level.
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Alerts for items nearing expiration.
- **Purchase Recommendations**: Suggests grocery purchases based on inventory levels and user preferences - in progress.
- **Data Visualization and Analytics**: Displays fridge statistics and consumption.
- **Recipe Suggestions**: Recommends recipes using the available ingredients in the fridge.
- **Highly Responsive App**: Receive real-time alerts about your products and fridge

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** React.js , TypeScript, Vite.
- **Backend:** Rest API using Flask (Python).
- **Database:** MySQL, MongoDB.
- **Deep learning:** Pytorch, YOLO, DeepSORT.
- **OCR:** EasyOCR.
- **LLM:** OpenAI.
- **Streaming Protocol:** RTSP (Real-Time Streaming Protocol).
- **WebSocket:** For real-time data communication between module and backend.

for a more detailed documentation about the feature and implementation, we have a more comprehensive readme in the folders for each of the app components


[Frontend documentation](https://github.com/tomerud/Freshlens/blob/main/frontend/README.md), 
[Backend documentation](https://github.com/tomerud/Freshlens/blob/main/backend/README.md) and
[Module Documentation](https://github.com/tomerud/Freshlens/blob/main/module/README.md)


## Project Status
While we have developt quite a bit, there are still things to expand this project, that due to time and money constraints we were unable to expand upon for now:
- Increase the dataset size for training the deep learning module.
- Switch to multi headed NN structure.
- Migrate to cloud services.
- Improve and expand the data science component.
- Enable other sensors beside cameras (temp, humidity etc)
- Ensure secure communication between IoT components (cameras and other sensors) and the application, as well as between the frontend and backend.


## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tomerud/Freshlens.git
cd Freshlens
pip install requirements.txt

cd ../frontend
npm run dev
```

in freshlens/backend/mysqlDB, put a .env file in this format:
```bash
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=  # fill your password
DB_NAME=freshlens
USDA_API_KEY=  # fill USDA API key
KAGGLE_DATASET=joelmills2/canadian-grocery-store-prices
KAGGLE_FILE_PATH=atlantic_superstore.csv
```

[you can get a USDA_API_KEY here](https://www.ers.usda.gov/developer/data-apis)
we have used OpenAI api key for generating recipes, to have that option working, you will need to replace it with your own.

## Usage
If its your first time, make sure you Go to freshlens-> backend and run the create table script:
```bash
cd backend
python -m mysqlDB.create_tables
```

and then also create the mongodb:
```bash
cd backend
python -m mongo.create_db
```

Set up backend server (for communicating between front and back):
```bash
cd backend
python server.py
```

Set up websocket server between module and backend:
```bash
cd backend
python -m module_connect
```

Start the app
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

To run a video file:
- First change the settings in the run_demo: Ip, Port and path to the video you want to run
(for now there is a "defult" setting that do work if you want to run as is)
then
from freshlens folder run the following code:

``` bash
cd freshlens
python -m module.run_demo
```


- Another option, [set up RTSP server on the computer](https://github.com/insight-platform/Fake-RTSP-Stream), change the settings in scheduler file and run
from freshlens folder

``` bash
python -m module.scheduler
```

for the updates from the module to be shown at the app, the Ip camera that is inserted must be connected to the user_id is on the app.
